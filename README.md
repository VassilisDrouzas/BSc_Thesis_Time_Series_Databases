This repository contains my BSc thesis in Time Series Database Management Systems (TSDBs). The thesis focuses on two parts:



a) Time Series databases, presenting their characteristics and making a comparison between them

b) Benchmarking between the TSDBs and publishing results. The benchmark section includes comparative analysis both on data ingestion and query execution.


For detailed instructions on how to use TSBS, check the section 7.2 on the thesis.
